- **🧩De-bitmap to fully use SVG**

  Full vectorisation (de-bitmap), due to the special use scenario of visualisation of large screens, the use of traditional bitmap situation graphics zoom details blurred, while the use of vector graphics details scaled can still maintain the original details clarity.

- **📊Enterprise splicing screen**

  In the face of the enterprise splicing screen, we have a very large number of display solutions, according to the customer's splicing screen equipment situation for custom development. The best display effect can be achieved under any equipment.


- **🌈 Intelligent colour matching for charts**

  With this framework, you can say goodbye to the headache of colour matching for charts. It provides the ability to colour match charts intelligently and the chart colouring tool.

- **🗺️GEO 3D Maps**
